**To run the code for the file "fao_data_livestock.py", the following materials and settings are needed**

1. Download normalized bulk data from FAOSTAT. One example is: https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Production_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip
2. Not all data are needed for different purposes, choose the right block in to code file
3. The targeted item filters are defined for each dataset. Some of them are coded differently, so I do not suggest using a universal filter for all datasets. You can customize the filter for wider or narrower products. 

**The file "lambda.py"**
Download the cleaned-out data first, then run this code
